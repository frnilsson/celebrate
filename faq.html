   	<h2><center>Important Things to Know</h2></center>
	<p align="justify"> We'll have answerss for hopefully all your questions. But if not please reach out and ask. </p> <br>


  	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9312 Is there a dress code?</b> <br>We want you to feel comfortable and confident on our special day! While we're celebrating in a casual cocktail style, we don't have a strict dress code. Feel free to wear whatever makes you happy and comfortable - whether that's a fancy cocktail dress, a stylish suit, or a pair of distressed denim jeans. Our goal is for everyone to have a great time, and we know that starts with feeling relaxed and at ease. So go ahead, get creative, and dress in a way that makes you feel like the best version of yourself (just no tuxes).</p>

	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9313 Will the ceremony be taking place indoors or outdoors?</b> <br>Celebration Pro Tip: Since we're partying al fresco (fancy for 'outside'), we've got a few things to keep in mind! Our ceremony will be shaded, but we want to warn you: our seats are more 'rustic chic' than 'plush luxury' (read: you'll be sitting on a wooden bench in our amphitheater). We've got some cushions to soften the deal, but let's just say we didn't order enough for everyone to get their own personal pillow fort. So, to avoid any accidental grass-staining, we suggest leaving the white dress at home unless you're feeling extra adventurous.</p>

	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9314 Has transport been arranged to and/or from the hotel to the venue?</b> <br>Yes, we will be providing shuttles from Santa Rosa and Calistoga to the venue. Please let us know in your RSVP if you would like a seat on the shuttle.</p>

	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9315 What will the weather be like??</b> <br>Weather Alert! Get ready for a sun-kissed celebration! We're expecting a beautiful day with temperatures soaring to around 90째F (that's 32째C for our international friends). But don't worry, as the sun sets, the temperature will dip into the comfortable 60s (15째C-20째C). While we will have shade, we recommend bringing some extra sun protection (hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, and lip balm) to keep you comfortable. If you have sensitive skin, don't forget to pack your favorite lotion or sunscreen to keep your skin happy. Layers are your friends, so dress in a way that allows you to adjust to the changing temps.</p>
			
 	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9316 Where can I park?</b> <br>There is no parking at the venue directly. You can either park at the Flamingo Resort in Santa Rosa, or Cal Mart in Calistoga and use our shuttle for transportation to the venue. Alternatetively you can use a rideshare service to drop you off at the venue.</p>    
  
   	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9317 How can I let you know about my dietary requirements?</b> <br>We have vegan and gluten free options included in the reception. We provide alcoholic and non-alcoholic and gluten free beverages. If you have any allergies please let us know so we can arrange a special meal for you.</p>    
    
   	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9318 Are children +1's invited?</b> <br>We love kids and plus ones, but unfortunately, our intimate venue has limited space. We kindly request that you find a babysitter for your kids and leave friends at home. We appreciate your understanding.</p> 

   	<p align="justify"> <b> &#9319 Should we bring gifts, or send them ahead of time?</b> <br>No, we don't want gifts. Just bring yourself. We don't have a registry because we already have too many things. If you would like, you can make a donation to the <a href="https://www.hospice.ie">Mayo Roscommon Hospice</a> or the <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/">Memmorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>. These foundations supports missions we care about and have low administrative fees.</p> 

    <p align="justify"> <b> &#9320 Is there a wedding hashtag?</b> <br>No, we won't have any hashtags to use with posting pictures on social media to avoid having our wedding all over the internet. Please don't post pictures publicly on social media. We will make sure that we have a private social media account that we share with all of you to post your pictures.</p>  

    <p align="justify"> <b> &#9321 Where can I have my cigarette?</b> <br>Smoking in public is limited in California. We ask you to adhere to the rules. Smoking is prohibited at the venue at any place or time other than in the designated smoking area. Guests at the Flamingo Resort are allowed to smoke on the parking lot but not on the property itself. </p>

   	<p align="justify"> We are celebrating at Branch House in Calistoga, CA on Saturday August 24, 2024. Located on Diamond Mountain, the venue overlooks Napa Valley and is surrounded by some of the world's finest vineyards. This picturesque setting provides a breathtaking backdrop for our special day.</p>

			
      <h3><center>Shuttles - starting 1:30pm</h3></center>

      <p align="justify"> We will have buses bringing people to Branch House from Santa Rosa and Calistoga. Buses will depart from Santa Rosa at the Flamingo Resort. In Calistoga the shuttles will pick up at Cal Mart. Please let us know in your RSVP if you are planning getting on the bus either in Santa Rosa or Calistoga so we can assign you a seat and departure time. There is no parking at the venue directly, however, you can have a rideshare drop you off.</p>

      <h3><center>Welcome Drinks - starting at 2pm</h3></center>

      <p align="justify"> Enjoy the time at Branch House with some welcome drinks and catch up with friends and make new friends while everyone is getting in. We'll have some music for you while you enjoy the views and take pictures.</p>

      <h3><center>Ceremony - 3:00 to 3:30pm</h3></center>

      <p align="justify"> The ceremony will be taking place in a little theater in the woods. It is only a short walk to get there. There is no reserved seating, you sit anywhere you want. Our dear friend Franco will lead us through a ceremony that celebrates our love and commitment to each other. Join us as we exchange vows and begin our new chapter together - we can't wait to share this special moment with you!</p>

      <h3><center>Cocktail Hour - 3:30 to 5:00pm</h3></center>

      <p align="justify"> Join us for a relaxing and social hour of mingling, sipping, and savoring! Our cocktail hour will feature refreshing drinks, delectable appetizers, and easy listening tunes to set the tone for a wonderful evening. Take a stroll around the grounds, catch up with old friends, or make some new ones. Feel free to challenge your friends to a game of giant Jenga - we'll provide the yard games and the fun! This is the perfect opportunity to unwind and enjoy the company of loved ones before the main celebration begins. Cheers!</p>    
      
      <h3><center>Reception - 5:00 to 10:30pm</h3></center>

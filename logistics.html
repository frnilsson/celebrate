   	<p align="justify"> We're thrilled to share our special day with you! To help you navigate your way to our celebration, we've put together some travel instructions and tips.</p>

			
      <h3><center>Airports</h3></center>

      <p align="justify"> The closest airport is Sonoma County Airport in Santa Rosa, however, most of you whon are flying in will most likely fly into San Francisco (SFO) which is approximately 80 miles from the wedding venue. </p>

      <h3><center>Accommodations</h3></center>

      <p align="justify"> We and Family will be staying at the Flamingo Resort in Santa Rosa. You can join us and book your room via their website. The nightly rate should be aorund 400 USD at that time of year. There are more budget friendly hotels in downtown Santa Rosa about a 10 min drive from the Flamingo, such as the Hyatt, Courtyard and AC Hotel that were recommended to us. If you decide to stay directly in Calistoga Dr. Wilkinson's Backyard Resort & Mineral Springs or Solage are nice places to stay at.</p>

   	<h2>Explore the Neighbourhood</h2>


<p align="justify"> Here are some things that Máire and I like in the area in case you have some extra time to explore.</p>

<h3>Wineries we &#10084 in Napa and Sonoma</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.hallwines.com/hall-schedule-a-tour-and-tasting">Hall Winery</a></b>: the vines that surround Branch House are sold directly to Hall. We are regulars at their St. Helena location and our current favorite is the Diamond Mountain Cab. We will have a taste of this with our dinner.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.untivineyards.com/">Unti</a></b>: an old favorite for many years and one of the first organic wineries in Sonoma County featuring mostly Itlaian verietals. They are located in the Dry Creek Valley. Our favorites are the Petit Frere and the Fiano. We will also drink some of these wines during our celebration.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.drycreekvineyard.com/">Dry Creek Vineyards</a></b>: also located in the Dry Creek Valley. They have a great outdoor space, and you can bring a picnic. Try their whites!!</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://montelena.com/">Cheateu Montelena</a></b>: the first wine to beat the old world vines in 1977 in Paris, added bonus Irish connection</p>

<h3>Fun Activities in Sonoma</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.winecountrybikes.com/resources/maps-routes/">Biking</a></b>: along Dry Creek Valley or from Napa to Yountville. You can do it yourself or with local tour guides. A nice way to explore the wineries.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://helenamtmaps.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=833371179fcc450498e863be6d530aa4">Hiking</a></b>: Mount Helena is pretty high. You can go all the way up or explore trails around the mountain. If not all of you are into hiking there is a way that you can meet your hiking friends at the summit by car.</p>

<h3>Fun Activities in San Francisco</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">SF MOMA</a></b>: downtown in SF, the MOMA currently has two exhibitions that we love - the listeners and yayoi kusama. We highly recommend going if you are passing through San Francisco. We are members and can hook you up with tickets if you want. Reach out! </p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm/">Alcatraz</a></b>: favorite of Dani, who didn't go for years because they thought it's not worth it. No, no, no,... totally go if you have the time. But you have to get your tickets in advance as ferries book out quickly.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/landsend.htm">Lands End</a></b>: probably the most beautiful spot in SF to see the sunset while going for an urban city hike. You don't have to come in your hiking gear, but opt for runner instead of flipflops. There are some hilly climbs and roots to hop over.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.goldengate.org/">Golden Gate Bridge</a></b>: take the ferry to sausalitos, have some fish there, take the bus towards SF, get off before the golden gate bridge and you can walk its entire length without paying any toll!!! Once on the SF side you can visit the gift shop and get on the bus again.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm">Muir Woods</a></b>: this is for you if you want to stroll among big redwood trees, just 45 min outside of SF. If you drive there you need to make a parking reservation in advance. Alternatively you can take a shuttle from Mill Valley. Muir Woods is a national monument and your America is beautiful pass gets you in for free. You can also hike in from the panoramic highway if you want to save some $$$.</p>


<h3>Food and Drinks in Calistoga</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/susiescalistoga/?hl=en">Suzie’s Bar Calistoga</a></b>: go here to play pool. If you're lucky you'll find Máire there. She is known for playing pool there for hours.</p>

<h3>Food and Drinks in Santa Rosa</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://my-abyssinia.com/">Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant</a></b>: we found this one randomly during our wedding prep when we checked out Santa Rosa. The food was delicious. The portions are quite large so very good opportunity to share.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://grossmanssr.com/">Grossman's Noshery & Bar</a></b>: very cool jewish bar deli combo. Get bagels, latkes, sandwiches and your schnitzel! They have a vegan menu too. We had dinner there before and will definitely go back while we're in Santa Rosa.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://starkrestaurants.com/stark-restaurant/willis-wine-bar/">Willi's Wine Bar</a></b>: On the list to try. We haven't been there yet. But they have a restaurant in Healdsburg which is in Máire's top10. So we have high expectations.</p>

<h3>Food and Drinks in San Francisco</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://casementsbar.com/">Casements</a></b>: an Irish beergarden in the Mission. Go there to drink your pint of Guiness, or have a fancy cocktail. Often they have bands playing too, or DJ's and dancing. Máire loves the curry chips.</p> 
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.tacos-el-patron.com/">Taco El Padron</a></b>: Máire's favorite mexican place in the city. If you go you have to order the birria tacos, with cheese!!</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.lolosf.com/">Lolo</a></b>: good mexican in the heart of Valencia street. Máire has never taken Dani there so we will make that happen soon.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.starbellysf.com/">Starbelly</a></b>: in the Castro if you want to go out for dinner before hitting all the gay bars. They have a nice back patio and can seat groups.</p>

<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.gialina.com/">Gialina</a></b>: more pizza. This time in Glen Park. Get the Moto pizza. This ended up on the menu because of Máire. She always ordered the Atomica plus sausage until they thought it's time that everyone should try it.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://eatmamahuhu.com/">Mamahuhu</a></b>: visit us in Noe Valley and we can meet there, or find their location in the Richmond. We used to pick up our farm share there every other week and got to know their menu quite well.</p>

<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.mrdigbys.com/">Mr Digby's</a></b>: a local neighborhood (Noe Valley) joint with a good happy hour. It's right next to where Dani's work shuttle drops them off, so Máire often takes Éire on a walk and we meet there.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.shizensf.com/">Shizen</a></b>: sushi for the vegans. Also for the non vegans, as these are creations that are very creative and super delicious. You need to make reservations well in advance though.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.burmasuperstar.com/">Burma Superstar</a></b>: if you haven't had Burmese food yet, we recommend you try. Burma Superstar is the original location, but they are all over SF and and the Eastbay. The tea leave salad is a must have.</p>

<p align="justify"> <b><a href="http://tcwus.com/">Terra Cotta Warrior</a></b>: shaanxi style chinese food. Get the Biang-Biang noodles. All of them. You'll love them. Dani is into the shaanxi cold noodles too.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a></b>: one of the best places for Dim Sum in San Francisco. They have multiple locations downtown. We go there often because one of their locations is right next to our doctors office.</p>

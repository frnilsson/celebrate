   	<h2>Explore the Neighbourhood</h2>


<p align="justify"> Here are some things that Máire and I like in the area in case you have some extra time to explore.</p>

<h3>Wineries we &#10084 in Napa and Sonoma</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.hallwines.com/hall-schedule-a-tour-and-tasting">Hall Winery</a></b>: the wines that surround Branch House are sold directly to Hall. We are regulars at their St. Helena location and our current favorite is the Walt. We will have a taste  with our dinner.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.untivineyards.com/">Unti</a></b>: an old favorite for many years and one of the first organic wineries in Sonoma County featuring mostly Itlaian verietals. They are located in the Dry Creek Valley. Our favorites are the Petit Frere and the Fiano. We will also drink some of these wines during our celebration.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.drycreekvineyard.com/">Dry Creek Vineyards</a></b>: also located in the Dry Creek Valley. They have a great outdoor space, and you can bring a picnic. Try their whites!!</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://montelena.com/">Cheateu Montelena</a></b>: the first wine to beat the old world vines in 1977 in Paris, added bonus Irish connection</p>

<h3>Fun Activities in Sonoma</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b>Biking</b>: along Dry Creek Valley or from Napa to Yountville.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b>Hiking</b>: Mount Helena or around Lake Sonoma.</p>

<h3>Fun Activities in San Francisco</h3>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">SF MOMA</a></b>: downtown in SF, the MOMA currently has two exhibitions that we love - the listeners and yayoi kusama. We highly recommend going if you are passing through San Francisco. We are members and can hook you up with tickets if you want. Reach out! </p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm/">Alcatraz</a></b>: favorite of Dani, who didn't go for years because they thought it's not worth it. No, no, no,... totally go if you have the time. But you have to get your tickets in advance as ferries book out quickly.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/landsend.htm">Lands End</a></b>: probably the most beautiful spot in SF to see the sunset while going for an urban city hike. You don't have to come in your hiking gear, but opt for runner instead of flipflops. There are some hilly climbs and roots to hop over.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.goldengate.org/">Golden Gate Bridge</a></b>: take the ferry to sausalitos, have some fish there, take the bus towards SF, get off before the golden gate bridge and you can walk its entire length without paying any toll!!! Once on the SF side you can visit the gift shop and get on the bus again.</p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a href="https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm">Muir Woods</a></b>: this is for you if you want to stroll among big redwood trees, just 45 min outside of SF. If you drive there you need to make a parking reservation in advance. Alternatively you can take a shuttle from Mill Valley. Muir Woods is a national monument and your america is beautiful pass gets you in for free. You can also hike in from the panoramic highway if you want to save some $$$.</p>
